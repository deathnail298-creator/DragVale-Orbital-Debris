Phase One – System Refinement & Scaling Framework

DragVale Orbital Debris Drag Amplification System

Status: Phase One (Prototype Development Framework)
Scope: Bridge between conceptual Phase Zero architecture and flight-ready prototype design.

1. Phase One Purpose & Scope

Phase One defines the engineering refinements, simulation tasks, subsystem validation steps, and multi-node scaling logic required to transition DragVale from a conceptual Phase Zero design into a buildable, testable prototype system.

Phase One does not deliver a full flight design. It delivers:

Engineering assumptions that must be validated

Subsystem refinement pathways

Material candidates and test matrices

Deployment mechanism engineering rules

Early dynamic and drag modeling tasks

Test guidelines for ground, vacuum, and vibration

Primary failure scenarios for mitigation planning

Production architecture scaling (three-drone chain)

Phase One exists to ensure that a real engineering team can begin procurement, prototyping, and simulation without ambiguity.

2. Subsystem Refinement Overview

Phase One requires refinement of all Phase Zero subsystems, focusing on:

Puff-Veil material and geometry

Deployment mechanism architecture

Veil frame tensioning method

ACS load envelope and torque budget

Host power stability and eclipse behavior

Structural anchoring and energy release limits

Veil survivability under AO/UV exposure

Host–veil dynamic coupling

Telemetry and sensorization needs (minimal but deliberate)

This section outlines the refinement direction for each subsystem.

3. Veil Material Candidates & Modeling Tasks
3.1 Material Candidates

Engineering teams should evaluate the following classes:

AO-resistant polyimides

Metallized ultra-thin polymer films

Reinforced nanofiber meshes

Aerogel-supported thin membranes

Hybrid mesh-film blends

3.2 Required Material Characterization

Teams must determine:

Areal density vs. stiffness tradeoff

Tear propagation characteristics

UV degradation rate

AO erosion rate

Thermal expansion coefficients

Mechanical behavior under tensioning

Survivability under repeated flexing

3.3 Drag Modeling Tasks

Teams must model:

Effective drag coefficient (Cd) of veil candidate materials

Drag dependence on porosity or mesh geometry

Oscillation amplitude vs. density variability

Drag effects on debris of varying sizes

CFD and simplified orbital drag models may both be used.
Phase One does not require high-fidelity multi-body simulations.

4. Host Drone Integration Refinements

Phase One requires refinement of the host subsystem:

4.1 Attitude Control Refinement

Determine torque budget from veil drag.

Select magnetorquer size and dipole authority accordingly.

Validate ACS stability under partial veil tear scenarios.

Characterize oscillation damping behavior.

4.2 Structural Integration

Define veil anchor strength requirements.

Identify load paths during deployment and tensioning.

Ensure frame release cannot impart destabilizing torques.

4.3 Power System Refinement

Verify solar panel output under veil shadowing conditions.

Model worst-case eclipse durations.

Validate thermal-induced battery behavior.

4.4 Avionics & Telemetry

Minimal sensor suite should include:

IMU

Temperature sensors

Optional tension/strain sensing at 1–2 veil nodes

Define downlink cadence and buffer needs.

5. Deployment Mechanism – Engineering Guidelines

Phase One transitions the deployment mechanism from concept → prototype-level engineering.

5.1 Required Tasks

Select passive release method (thermal link, frangible tie, memory-material release).

Define deployment sequence timing.

Determine rate of expansion to avoid host torque spikes.

Simulate partial-release edge cases.

Validate no stored energy levels exceed safety limits.

5.2 Deployment Testing

Teams must perform:

Vacuum deployment tests

Thermal deployment tests

Vibration-survivability tests

Deployment symmetry verification

Post-deployment geometry measurements

6. ACS Load Envelope & Dynamics

Phase One requires characterization of:

Drag-induced torque magnitude

Oscillation modes (longitudinal, transverse, torsional)

ACS duty cycle under varying density

Worst-case disturbance loads

Settling periods after deployment

Teams should verify that ACS maintains attitude with:

Fully deployed veil

Partially torn veil

Asymmetric tensioning

Thermal-warped veil edges

7. Initial Testing Plan (Ground, Vacuum, Vibe)

Engineering teams are expected to execute minimum testing:

7.1 Ground Testing

Veil material tensile tests

Tear propagation testing

Tension uniformity checks

Veil-to-frame integration

Deployment mechanism dry-runs

7.2 Thermal Vacuum Testing

Deployment in vacuum

Veil stiffness at extreme temperatures

ACS sensor stability under thermal load

AO exposure surrogate testing if available

7.3 Vibration Testing

Host+veil stowed configuration must survive:

Random vibration

Sine sweeps

Pyroshock (if applicable to launch vehicle)

8. Multi-Veil Scaling (Three-Drone Chain Architecture)

Phase One formally introduces the production-grade design:

A three-drone DragVale chain spaced along the same orbital track.

8.1 Purpose

Increase encounter probability

Multiply drag events

Reduce debris lifetime significantly faster

Enable “drag corridors” in high-traffic orbital shells

8.2 Conceptual Layout

Drone 1 → Drone 2 → Drone 3
Each separated by an orbital phase offset (variable, TBD).

8.3 Expected Scaling Effects

Sequential velocity reductions

Compound perigee lowering

Broader influence on debris populations

Increased statistical effectiveness without increased complexity per node

8.4 Required Phase One Tasks

Modeling veil spacing and phasing

Multi-veil interaction effects

Cumulative drag envelopes

Cross-node interference (expected to be minimal)

Chain survivability under varied density regimes

Multi-node behavior is a Phase One-only analytical requirement — no hardware needed yet.

9. Phase One Performance Modeling Tasks

Teams should evaluate:

Drag envelope for single-veil system

Drag envelope for 3-veil chain

Host orbital decay sensitivity

Debris population interaction rate

Survivability curve of veil under AO/UV

Partial-tear behavior effects on drag

Phase One only requires first-order models — enough to inform Phase Two prototype development.

10. Risk Reduction Tasks for Phase Two

Phase One identifies and mitigates the following risk classes:

Deployment asymmetry

Veil tear propagation

ACS oversaturation

High-density atmospheric spikes

Veil thermal-warp oscillations

Material embrittlement

Unexpected torque coupling

Shadowing-induced power deficits

Host–veil structural creep

Phase One success criteria include:

Defined ACS torque budget

Defined deployment rate envelope

Material characterization data

Validated survivability under testing

Defined multi-node chain spacing model

11. Phase One Deliverables

Phase One is complete when the following exist:

Material selection report

Deployment mechanism prototype

ACS torque and load envelope

Initial drag performance model

Thermal-vacuum test results

Vibration survivability report

Multi-node chain spacing and scaling model

Risk reduction closure document

Go/No-Go manufacturing criteria for Phase Two

At this point, teams can begin Phase Two – Prototype Construction & Flight Hardware Development.
